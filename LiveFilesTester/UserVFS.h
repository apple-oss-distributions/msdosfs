 *                          being renamed.
 *
 *     toDirNode            The directory that will contain the renamed file
 *                          system object. Note that this *may* be equal to
 *                          fromDirNode.
 *
 *     toNode               The file system object if destination exists and has
 *                          been looked up before.
 *
 *     toName               The new name of the file system object being renamed
 *                          within toDir.
 *
 *     flags                Flags to control the rename operation.  Valid
 *                          flags are LI_RENAME_SWAP and LI_RENAME_EXCL.
 *                          See rename(2) for discussion of these options.
 *
 * NOTE ABOUT fromNode:
 * fromNode *may* or *may not* be NULL when (*fsops_rename)() is called.  If it
 * is *not NULL*, then it means there is currently a valid file handle vended
 * to a client that must remain valid and usable regardless of the success or
 * failure of the rename operation.  Any in-memory state needed to meet this
 * requirement MUST be updated in the fileNode if it is provided.
 *
 * NOTE ABOUT toNode: In case of the toNode been non-null marking
 *                    the state, pointed by toNode, as dead must be done.
 *                    Silly rename strategy of moving allocated space to invalid
 *                    directory name which can be cleaned up during reclaim is encouraged.
 *                    After marking the state as dead, reclaim operation must finish
 *                    without errors.
 *
 * The basic algorithm is as follows:
 *
 *      If there is already an object at the "to" location, ensure the objects are compatible:
 *          -- If the "from" object is not a directory and the "to" object is a directory,

 *          -- If the "from" object is a directory and the "to" object is not a directory,
 *             the operation shall fail with ENOTDIR.
 *
 *      If a file move:
 *          -- If the destination file exists:
 *              -- Remove the destination file.
 *          -- If source and destination are in the same directory:

 *          else:
 *              -- Write new entry in destination directory.
 *              -- Clear old directory entry.
 *
 *      If a directory move:

 * int (*fsops_readdirattr)(UVFSFileNode dirNode, void *buf, size_t buflen, uint64_t cookie, size_t *bytes_read, uint64_t *verifier);
 *
 * These routines are used to enumerate a directory specified by dirNode.  The
 * directory entry information is packed into the buffer buf of size buflen
 * provided by the caller as an array of UVFSDirEntry (or UVFSDirEntryAttr)
 * structures, which vary in length.  cookie is used to indicate the location
 * within the directory to enumerate from, bytes_read is the amount of bytes of
 * the directory read and stored in buf, and verifier is a mechanism to ensure
 * that the provided cookie is valid for the current version of the directory.
 *
 * The general flow of a readdir is as follows: When an enumeration is started,
 * (*fsops_readdir)() will be called with a cookie of 0 and a *verifier equal to
 * UVFS_DIRCOOKIE_VERIFIER_INITIAL.  A cookie of 0 indicates that enumeration starts
 * at the first entry, and the *verifier value of UVFS_DIRCOOKIE_VERIFIER_INITIAL
 * indicates that the verifier should not be compared.  After packing the initial
 * set of directory entries into the caller's buffer, (*fsops_readdir)() sets
 * *verifier to a non-zero value that reflects the directory's current version,
 * sets *bytes_read to the number of bytes read and stored in buf, and returns 0 to
 * the caller. When next called, (*fsops_readdir)() first compares the value of
 * *verifier with the directory's current version.  If they match, then
 * (*fsops_readdir)() packs the next set of directory entries into the caller's
 * buffer starting with the entry associated with cookie.  If the passed in verifier
 * does not match, then UVFS_READDIR_VERIFIER_MISMATCHED must be returned so that the upper
 * layers know to restart directory enumeration.  If cookie is equal to UVFS_DIRCOOKIE_EOF,
 * then UVFS_READDIR_EOF_REACHED must be returned.  If cookie does not resolve to a valid
 * directory entry, then UVFS_READDIR_BAD_COOKIE must be returned.
 *
 * UVFSDirEntry structures are variable length, to pack them into the buffer as
 * efficiently as possible.  The caller can calculate the size of the directory
 * entry using the provided convenience macro UVFS_DIRENTRY_COPYSIZE(namelen), where
 * namelen is the length of the entry's name in UTF8 not including the terminating NUL
 * (as if the length were calculated with the strlen() routine).  If the entry
 * fits into the caller's buffer, the entry should be stored in the caller's buffer.
 * The convenience macro UVFS_DIRENTRY_RECLEN(namelen) is used to calculate the rounded
 * size of the entry (required to ensure proper alignment of subsequent entries in
 * the caller's buffer).  This value should also be stored in the de_nextrec
 * field.  The last entry stored in the caller's buffer should contain a de_nextrec
 * value of 0.  If the end of the directory is reached, the last entry should have
 * a de_nextcookie value set to UVFS_DIRCOOKIE_EOF; otherwise, de_nextcookie should be
 * set to a valid cookie value for that directory entry.
 *
 * Note: There should always be at least two entries in a directory: "." (an entry
 * corresponding to the current directory) and ".." (an entry representing the
 * parent directory).  These entries are standard UVFS_FA_TYPE_DIR entries.  In the case
 * of the root directory of the file system, "." and ".." have identical contents.
 *
 * In addition to the return values above, return 0 on success or an appropriate
 * errno value for any other kind of failure.  In particular, E2BIG should be returned
 * if there is not enough space in the caller's buffer to store at least one maximum-size
 * directory entry record.
 *
 * The (*fsops_readdirattr)() function is identical to (*fsops_readdir)() with two
 * key differences:
 *
 *  --> It returns UVFSDirEntryAttr records.  These records include the attributes
 *      of the file system object referenced by the directory entry.
 *
 *  --> Records for "." and ".." are not returned in the results.
 *
 * Some care is required when constructing a UVFSDirEntryAttr record:
 *
 *  --> fa_type and fa_fileid MUST be returned.
 *
 *  --> The dea_nameoff member MUST be initialized to UVFS_DIRENTRYATTR_NAMEOFF.
 *
 *  --> The start of the name string in the record MUST be obtained using the
 *      UVFS_DIRENTRYATTR_NAMEPTR() macro AFTER initializing dea_nameoff.
 *
 * The plugin must ensure that names returned as part of UVFSDirEntry (or UVFSDirEntryAttr)
 * structures are acceptable and unambiguous input to all file operations that take names
 * (like (*fsops_lookup)()) without additional normalization. The plugin should also be aware that
